# YouTube Homepage Clone

## Project Overview
The YouTube Homepage Clone is a simplistic web application that mimics the layout of the YouTube homepage. This project showcases various features typically found on YouTube, including a search bar, video thumbnails, and a sidebar navigation. The application serves as a great exercise in front-end development, providing an opportunity to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation
To get started with the YouTube Homepage Clone, simply clone or download the repository. There’s no need for a complex setup or server, as this application runs entirely in the browser.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-homepage-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd youtube-homepage-clone
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the cloned YouTube homepage. Experiment with the search bar and navigation buttons. Although the video grid doesn't display real videos, you can see the structure and styling that resembles the actual YouTube interface.

## Features
- Responsive Header Navigation with buttons for menu, search, create, notifications, and sign-in.
- Sidebar navigation with links for Home, Shorts, Subscriptions, and more.
- Main content area encouraging users to search for videos.
- Comprehensive structure for displaying video cards, including video title, channel name, and view count.

## Dependencies
This project does not rely on any external libraries or frameworks, and hence, no dependencies are listed in a `package.json` file. All the styles and functionalities are created using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
